TABLEAU connect, calculate, and visualize. 
Can create graphs, charts, reports, dashboards.
The goal is to help users project their data by offering a huge variety of data visualization tools to choose from.
Pre-procressing on a database level has better performance. 


-----------------------------------
Task1: 
Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990



--------------------------------------
Task2:
Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.


--------------------------------------
Task 3:
Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.



--------------------------------------
Task4:
Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range.
Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.
Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.
